## Terminology

**POCUS** = Point-of-Care Ultrasound (*preferred*)  
**FAST** = Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma(, Triage and Tracking)  
**Vet BLUE** = Veterinary Bedside Lung Ultrasound Exam

## Physics

#### Piezoelectric Effect

Piezoelectric effect is the ability for certain materials to **generate an electrical charge in response to applied mechanical stress (ultrasound waves)**.

Ultrasound probes contain **piezoelectric crystals**, which regenerate ultrasound waves when a voltage is applied to them (reverse piezoelectric effect). Similarly, when ultrasound waves hit these crystals, small voltages are generated via the piezoelectric effect which are processed into an image.

#### Ultrasound Waves

Piezoelectric crystals produce sound waves at extremely high frequencies (**3-14 MHz**), above the hearing range (ultrasound).

#### Behaviour of Ultrasound Waves

##### Reflection

Reflection of ultrasound waves back to the probe is what allows for an image to be generated.

Different tissues reflect varying amounts of ultrasound, resulting in differences in echogenicity.

Deeper tissues take a longer time to reflect ultrasound, allowing for depth perception.

Ultrasound will be strongly reflected at an interface with a large acoustic impedence difference (see below).

##### Absorption /  Attenuation

Bone and air has the highest attenuation, resulting in shadowing artefacts.  
Fluid has minimal attentuation, resulting in acoustic enhancement artefact deep to the fluid.

Ultrasound with lower frequencies undergo less attenuation, allowing for deeper tissue penetration.

##### Scatter

When the angle of insonance (angle of incidence) is not zero, soundwaves are reflected away and not received by the probe.

Image quality is best when the probe is directly perpendicular to the area of interest.

#### Acoustic Impedance

Acoustic impedance (Z) = tissue density (p) Ã— velocity (v)

**Air** has very low acoustic impedance (**0**) due to low density and slow speed of sound in air.  
**Bone** has a very high acoustic impedance (**7.8**) due to a high tissue density and fast speed of sound in bone.  
**Soft tissue** have similar acoustic impedance between **1.4-1.7**.

At soft tissue-bone or soft-tissue-air interfaces, nearly all the sound waves are strongly reflected, resulting in a hyperechogenic line and shadowing.

## Getting Started

### Positioning & Patient Preparation

Ideally, the patient should be facing the screen of the ultrasound machine, so that the patient can be monitored during the POCUS.

The ultrasound machine should be positioned so that buttons are readily accessible and the image can be viewed without having to look over your shoulder.

Most POCUS can be done in a comfortable patient position. This is helpful as minimal repositioning is required for the painful or unstable patient.

The hair of the patient does *not* need to be clipped. Part the hair and use methylated spirits (70% ethanol), acoustic coupling gel, or alcoholic hand gel.

### Probe Selection

The three basic probe types are:

#### Linear
- Best image quality with no distortion.
- However, it uses higher frequencies and hence have a limited depth penetration.
- Best for imaging shallow structures of interest in detail.

#### Curvilinear (Microconvex & Macroconvex)
- Most versatile, range of frequencies allow for deeper imaging.
- Curved probe allows for a wider image despite a smaller footprint.
- A microconvex probe with a frequency of ~8 MHz is recommended for most POCUS.

#### Phased-array (sector)
- Ultrasound is generated from a single point in the probe.
- Most useful for echocardiograms as it avoids shadowing artefact from the ribs.

### Orientation

**Probe marker**: Pointing **cranially**, or to the **right** of the the patient.

On the screen, the **probe marker should be positioned to the left**, so that the **left of the screen** corresponds to:  
**Cranial** in longitudinal views.  
**Right** of the patient in transverse views.

### Imaging Optimisation (Knobology)

#### Presets

Start by choosing the most appropriate preset (even if it is for humans, not animals).

#### Frequency

Most ultrasound probes have a range of frequency. The most appropriate frequency is the highest one (for the best image detail) which allows for adequate visualisation of the structure of interest at a given depth.

In general, the **bigger** the patient and **deeper** the structures of interest, the **lower** the frequency should be used.

As a guide,
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0);border:0px">
    <td><b>Cats and small dogs</b></td>
    <td>Up to 10cm in depth</td>
    <td><b>~ 8 MHz</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0);border:0px">
    <td><b>Larger dogs</b></td>
    <td>More than 10cm in depth</td>
    <td><b>~ 5 MHz</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Gain

Adjust the **overall gain** first. Be careful of over adjustment as it can lead to loss of image detail.

Use the **time gain compensation (TGC)** to increase brightness particularly at deeper depth.

#### Depth

Ideally, your structure of interest should be roughly 60% of the screen or a third to halfway of the depth.

Always be mindful of your scale located to the side of the image as structures can be easily magnified.

#### Focus

Focus number: One focus is recommended. Multiple focuses can result in lower screen refresh rates and lag times as the processor struggles.

Focus position: At the level of the structure of interest or just slighlty below it.
