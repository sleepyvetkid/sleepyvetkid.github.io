## Interpretation

Dogs in shock tend to have a higher shock index compared to those who are not, however there is a significant overlap between the two groups.<sup>1</sup>

Healthy: 0.78 (0.37-1.30)
<br>In shock: 1.37 (0.87-3.12)

In humans, a shock index of 0.5-0.7 is normal, while >0.9 is indicative of serious disease and requires immediate attention.

A <b>cutoff of ~0.9-1.0</b> is most often cited, with reported sensitivities of 68-90% and specificities of 50-95%.
<br>Values above ≥1.25/1.65 should prompt investigation for hemorrhagic shock.

## Description

In humans, the shock index is found to correlate with shock (particularly due to blood loss), disease severity and mortality. Studies evaluating  its use in veterinary patients have found some utility but largely remain inconclusive due to conflicting studies and the lack of good large-scale studies.

## Pros

- The shock index makes sense by physiological reasoning.

- It is easy to use without significant tests except for obtaining blood pressure.

## Cons

- There is much overlap between healthy patients and those in shock. This is likely due to:
    - Tachycardia due to fear, stress and pain.
    - Accuracy of systolic blood pressure — none of the methods of non-invasive blood pressure measurement have been found to be accurate compared to invasive blood pressure measurements, especially in hypotensive patients.

- Studies evaluating its utility in veterinary patients have been conflicting and most of them have small population sizes.

- Almost all of the studies focused on hypovolemic shock due to blood loss (hemorrhagic shock). There has been no testing for other types of shock e.g. vasodilatory shock.

- It might not be a sensitive tool as an estimate of 15-30% of blood loss is required before any changes in heart rate and blood pressure occurs. In fact, tachycardia (>120 bpm, sensitivity 97%, specificity 76%) alone was more sensitive for detecting shock in dogs!<sup>2</sup> Hypotension had bad sensitivity (34%) but excellent specificity (92%) for shock.<sup>2</sup>

- The shock index can only be applied to dogs, not cats. Cats tend to have decompensated shock and bradycardia.

## Recommendations

The shock index is unlikely to provide much more information but rather emphasises that certain physiological parameters like heart rate and blood pressure are important when evaluating the cardiovascular system.

Veterinarians should not use it to make a prognosis.
