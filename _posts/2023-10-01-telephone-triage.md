  <li><b>Communicate</b> to the team so that they can prepare.</li>
</ul>

<!-- What is Phone Triage? -->

## What is Telephone Triage?

Triage starts as soon as the client calls and speaks to somebody over the phone. This call is often taken by receptionists (customer service representatives) who should be trained to identify common emergencies over the phone.

Clients do not always appreciate the severity of their pets' conditions. As such, the responsibility falls onto the staff member speaking to the client to advise if the pet needs to be seen sooner.

## First Aid (Pre-Hospital Care)

### General Concepts
<ul>
  <li>Stay calm. Breathe.</li>
  <li>Be safe. Patients might be stressed or in pain and may bite.</li>
  <li>Prevent further harm to the patient.</li>
  <li>Do not delay transport to a veterinary clinic to manage a problem that is not immediately life-threatening.</li>
</ul>

<!-- First Aid: CPR -->

### Collapsed, Non-Responsiveness, Apnoea, Cardiopulmonary Arrest

      <ul>
        <li><b>Most dogs (≥ 7kg):</b> Lie the patient on the side. Push firmly on the highest point of the chest. Depress the chest by 1/3 to 1/2. </li>
        <li><b>Cats and small dogs (< 7kg):</b> Use one hand to squeeze directly over the heart, just behind the point of the elbow. Squeeze firmly.</li>
        <li>100-120 compressions per minute, or to the beat of 'Stayin' Alive' by the Bee Gees. Count out the compressions over the phone to help.</li>

      <summary>Outcomes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Successful CPR:</b> Transport the patient to a veterinary clinic ASAP, as reoccurrence of arrest is very likely.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Unsuccessful CPR:</b> Decide whether or not to continue. If so, continue CPR enroute to a veterinary clinic. The clients need to be aware of:

<details>
  <summary>Pressure bandage</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply <b><i>firm</i> pressure</b> over the source of bleeding using a bandaging material or a clean cloth.</li>
    <li>
      Wrap the dressing <b>around the limb or body</b> firmly.
      <ul>
        <li>A <u>circumferential</u> pressure bandage is ideal, as non-circumferential dressings do not provide sufficient pressure.</li>
        <li>Do not be afraid of wrapping too tightly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If <b>strikethrough</b> occurs, do <i>not</i> remove the first dressing. Simply apply more dressing over the first with more pressure.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Penetrating wounds</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not remove penetrating object.</li>
        <li>Pack dressing around the penetrating object to create a bulk dressing.</li>
        <li>Be careful not to push the object deeper.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Immobilisation & Elevation</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Restrict movement.</b> Carry patient if possible.</li>
    <li>
      <i>For bleeding from the extremities:</i>
      <ul>
        <li>A temporary splint/cast can be fashioned out of a rolled newspaper/towel to restrict movement.</li>
        <li>Elevate the wound (above the heart) by 15-30°.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Tourniquet</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Not recommended. Too dangerous as it can potentially cut off blood supply.</li>
    <li>
      Only use a tourniquet as a last resort if:
      <ul>
        <li>Hemorrhage is severe and life-threatening, e.g. arterial bleeding, and;</li>
        <li>Other attempts at hemostasis have failed, and;</li>
        <li>Recognising that the limb or tail might require amputation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>How to apply a tourniquet.</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a wide (2-inch or more) piece of cloth and wrap it around the limb twice and tie it into a knot.</li>
          <li>Tie a short stick or similar object into the knot as well. Twist the stick to tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding stops.</li>
          <li>Secure the stick in place with another piece of cloth and write down the time it was applied.</li>
          <li>Loosen the tourniquet every 20 minutes for 15 to 20 seconds.</li>

<!-- Burns / Large Open Wounds -->

### Burns, Open Wounds

<details>
  <summary>Clean</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Irrigate the wound with copious amounts of cool tap water.
      <ul>
        <li>For <b>minor superficial wounds</b>, the longer the better. Aim to wash the wound under running tap water for at least <b>5 minutes</b> if the patient would tolerate.</li>
        <li>For <b>major deeper wounds</b> that require immediate veterinary attention, just try and get any gross contamination off (maximum 1-2 minutes). <b>Do not delay transport</b> to clean the wound thoroughly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Chemical burns:</b> <i>Thorough</i> cleaning to remove all of the offending substance is important. Consider a bath if appropriate.</li>
    <li>Water is just as good as sterile saline for cleaning superficial wounds.<sup>2</sup></li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cover</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply a <b>light dressing</b> to any open wound using bandage material or a clean cloth.</li>
    <li>If the burns or wounds are extensive, prioritise on the larger ones or simply cover the patient with a large clean blanket and do not delay transport to a veterinary clinic.</li>
    <li>For minor superficial wounds to be managed at home, <b>antiseptics</b> can be applied and a sterile dressing should be used.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Keep warm</summary>
  <ul>For patients with extensive burns covering more than 20% of the body surface area, there is a risk of loss of fluids and hypothermia. Keep the patient warm with a large blanket.</ul>

### Snake Envenomation

Do not apply tourniquet.

<!-- Transportation -->

## Transportation

&#10071; Be careful! The patient may bite due to pain, stress or fear. Go slow and be mindful of any painful areas.

<b>General Tips</b>

Minimise movement, keep the patient calm and comfortable. This is especially important for patients in respiratory distress.

Drive safely.

<details>
  <summary><b>Makeshift Muzzle</b></summary>
  <ul>
    A makeshift muzzle using a dog leash, tie or a piece of rope can be very helpful to secure dogs who might bite.
    <img src="/assets/images/2023-10-01-telephone-triage/makeshift-muzzle.png" alt="How to make a make-shift muzzle">
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Makeshift Stretcher/Sling</b></summary>
  <ul>
    A large towel or blanket can be used as a make-shift stretcher for non-ambulatory large dogs.
    <br>If the patient is weak but still have some movement in the legs, a larget towel can be used as a sling under the pelvis to support their weight to help them walk.
  </ul>
</details>

### Where to go?

For true emergencies, this will be the closest available veterinary clinic, or the regular veterinary clinic if it is located within reasonable distance.

Consider if the veterinary clinic would be suitably equipped to deal with this particular emergency. Some veterinary clinics might not have the provision for long-term oxygen therapy, or stock expensive antivenom or antidotes.

If overnight care with monitoring is required, and the client is able and willing to afford it, then perhaps the client should be sent directly to the emergency centre.

On the other hand, it might be better for the patient to be stabilised and receive pain relief at a general practice veterinary clinic first, before referring to an emergency centre.

There are also clients who cannot afford intensive care at the emergency centre and they would prefer to discuss their options with their primary veterinarians instead of being out of pocket just for turning up at the emergency centre.

At the end of the day, it really depends on the nature of the emergency and the preference of the client to pursue a high but expensive level of care at the emergency centre or a more modest but more budget-friendly option at their primary veterinary clinic.

However, if a true emergency is identified over the phone, the clinic must not turn the client away even if they cannot pay. The client should be asked to bring the patient in regardless, and finances can be discussed afterwards. If the client still refuses to bring the patient in, a free welfare consultation can be offered. This provides the veterinarian an opportunity to safeguard the welfare of the patient by providing pain relief and potentially some stabilisation, and to speak in person to the client. In reality, if they cannot pay for consultations, most emergencies are expensive to treat and welfare euthanasia is the usual outcome.

<!-- Others -->

## Welfare

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for emergencies to happen to clients who cannot pay. Veterinarians have an obligation to protect the welfare of animals, and so they cannot turn away these clients. Veterinary clinics should be prepared to provide free pain relief and welfare euthanasia. In rare instances, a patient may be surrendered to the veterinary clinic or an animal charity organisation so that veterinary care can be paid for by somebody else.

There might also be times when these clients might refuse to come to the veterinary clinic, for fear of having to put their pet to sleep. This is a difficult scenario and unfortunately, the veterinarian has to do what is best for the animal. The topic of euthanasia is best avoided over the phone and the goal is to convince the client to come into the veterinary clinic, so that the patient might receive pain relief and be assessed by a veterinarian. Once in the clinic, the veterinarian would have the opportunity to chat with the client and perhaps convince them of the rationale for welfare euthanasia, if necessary.

It is rare for a veterinary clinic to have to refuse to return a patient to a client and/or perform welfare euthanasia without the client's consent.
