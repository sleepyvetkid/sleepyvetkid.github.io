## What is Telephone Triage?

Triage starts as soon as the client calls and speaks to somebody over the phone. This call is often taken by receptionists (customer service representatives) who should be trained to identify common emergencies over the phone.

Clients do not always appreciate the severity of their pets' conditions. As such, the responsibility falls onto the staff member speaking to the client to advise if the pet needs to be seen sooner.

## First Aid (Pre-Hospital Care)

### General Concepts
<ul>
  <li>Stay calm. Breathe.</li>
  <li>Be safe. Patients might be stressed or in pain and may bite.</li>
  <li>Prevent further harm to the patient.</li>
  <li>Do not delay transport to a veterinary clinic to manage a problem that is not immediately life-threatening.</li>
</ul>

<!-- First Aid: CPR -->

      <summary>Chest compressions.</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Most dogs (≥ 7kg):</b> Lie the patient on the side. Push firmly on the highest point of the chest. Depress the chest by 1/3 to 1/2. </li>
        <li><b>Cats and small dogs (< 7kg):</b> Use one hand to squeeze directly over the heart, just behind the point of the elbow. Squeeze firmly.</li>
        <li>100-120 compressions per minute, or to the beat of 'Stayin' Alive' by the Bee Gees. Count out the compressions over the phone to help.</li>

        <li>Being dead prior to starting CPR and/or CPR without return to spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for > 4 minutes carries a guarded prognosis.<br>It is reasonable to call off CPR after <b>10-15 minutes (~4-6 rounds of CPR)</b>.</li>
        <li>At some point, it would be unreasonable to continue CPR e.g. 1 hour.</li>

      <summary>Outcomes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Successful CPR:</b> Transport the patient to a veterinary clinic ASAP, as reoccurrence of arrest is very likely.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Unsuccessful CPR:</b> Decide whether or not to continue. If so, continue CPR enroute to a veterinary clinic. The clients need to be aware of:
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>guarded prognosis</b> even if the patient was brought into a veterinary clinic.</li>
            <li>The <b>prolonged hospital stay</b> required after a cardiopulmonary arrest event. This will be <b>very expensive</b>.</li>

<!-- First Aid: Bleeding -->

### Bleeding (External Hemorrhage)

<blockquote style="width:100%;padding:20px;text-align:center;">
RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation

<details>
  <summary>Pressure bandage</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply <b><i>firm</i> pressure</b> over the source of bleeding using a bandaging material or a clean cloth.</li>
    <li>
      Wrap the dressing <b>around the limb or body</b> firmly.
      <ul>
        <li>A <u>circumferential</u> pressure bandage is ideal, as non-circumferential dressings do not provide sufficient pressure.</li>
        <li>Do not be afraid of wrapping too tightly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If <b>strikethrough</b> occurs, do <i>not</i> remove the first dressing. Simply apply more dressing over the first with more pressure.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Penetrating wounds</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not remove penetrating object.</li>
        <li>Pack dressing around the penetrating object to create a bulk dressing.</li>
        <li>Be careful not to push the object deeper.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Immobilisation & Elevation</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Restrict movement.</b> Carry patient if possible.</li>
    <li>
      <i>For bleeding from the extremities:</i>
      <ul>
        <li>A temporary splint/cast can be fashioned out of a rolled newspaper/towel to restrict movement.</li>
        <li>Elevate the wound (above the heart) by 15-30°.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Tourniquet</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Not recommended. Too dangerous as it can potentially cut off blood supply.</li>
    <li>
      Only use a tourniquet as a last resort if:
      <ul>
        <li>Hemorrhage is severe and life-threatening, e.g. arterial bleeding, and;</li>
        <li>Other attempts at hemostasis have failed, and;</li>
        <li>Recognising that the limb or tail might require amputation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>How to apply a tourniquet.</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a wide (2-inch or more) piece of cloth and wrap it around the limb twice and tie it into a knot.</li>
          <li>Tie a short stick or similar object into the knot as well. Twist the stick to tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding stops.</li>
          <li>Secure the stick in place with another piece of cloth and write down the time it was applied.</li>
          <li>Loosen the tourniquet every 20 minutes for 15 to 20 seconds.</li>

  <summary>Topical hemostatic agent</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>There are many available, with different active ingredients and varying efficacy.</li>
    <li>Some produce an exothermic reaction when activated, which can burn the patient, and should be avoided.</li>
    <li>There are little to no studies on the veterinary use of these hemostatic agents, so much of the application is extrapolated from human medicine. </li>

### Burns, Open Wounds

<details>
  <summary>Clean</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Irrigate the wound with copious amounts of cool tap water.
      <ul>
        <li>For <b>minor superficial wounds</b>, the longer the better. Aim to wash the wound under running tap water for at least <b>5 minutes</b> if the patient would tolerate.</li>
        <li>For <b>major deeper wounds</b> that require immediate veterinary attention, just try and get any gross contamination off (maximum 1-2 minutes). <b>Do not delay transport</b> to clean the wound thoroughly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Chemical burns:</b> <i>Thorough</i> cleaning to remove all of the offending substance is important. Consider a bath if appropriate.</li>
    <li>Water is just as good as sterile saline for cleaning superficial wounds.<sup>2</sup></li>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cover</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply a <b>light dressing</b> to any open wound using bandage material or a clean cloth.</li>
    <li>If the burns or wounds are extensive, prioritise on the larger ones or simply cover the patient with a large clean blanket and do not delay transport to a veterinary clinic.</li>
    <li>For minor superficial wounds to be managed at home, <b>antiseptics</b> can be applied and a sterile dressing should be used.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>

### Snake Envenomation

Do not apply tourniquet.

<!-- Transportation -->

## Transportation

&#10071; Be careful! The patient may bite due to pain, stress or fear. Go slow and be mindful of any painful areas.

<b>General Tips</b>

Minimise movement, keep the patient calm and comfortable. This is especially important for patients in respiratory distress.

Drive safely.

<details>
  <summary><b>Makeshift Muzzle</b></summary>
  <ul>
    A makeshift muzzle using a dog leash, tie or a piece of rope can be very helpful to secure dogs who might bite.

  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Makeshift Stretcher/Sling</b></summary>
  <ul>
    A large towel or blanket can be used as a make-shift stretcher for non-ambulatory large dogs.
    <br>If the patient is weak but still have some movement in the legs, a larget towel can be used as a sling under the pelvis to support their weight to help them walk.
  </ul>
</details>

### Where to go?

For true emergencies, this will be the closest available veterinary clinic, or the regular veterinary clinic if it is located within reasonable distance.

Ideally, the patient is stabilised and provided pain relief at the earliest opportunity, and then referred to an emergency centre for ongoing care, if required.

However, occasionally, the nearest clinic might not be adequately equipped to deal with a particular emergency (e.g. provide prolonged oxygen therapy, administer antivenom or other antidotes). Emergency centres represent the best chance for patients with true emergencies and those who require critical care.

While it might make sense to direct emergencies that would likely require intensive care (e.g. DKA) straight to the emergency centre, some clients might not be able to afford the expensive emergency room and ICU care. They might appreciate during this stressful time, speaking first to their primary veterinarian whom they have a relationship with, before making the decision to go to the ER.

Ultimately, it depends on the nature of the emergency and the individual preference of the client.

<!-- Others -->

## Welfare

For those who work in the ER, it is not uncommon to encounter clients who cannot pay. Veterinarians have an obligation to protect the welfare of animals, and so they cannot turn away these clients. Veterinary clinics should be prepared to provide free pain relief and welfare euthanasia. This is the least we can do. In very rare instances, a patient may be surrendered to the veterinary clinic or an animal charity organisation so that veterinary care can be paid for by somebody else.

There might also be times when a client might refuse to come to the veterinary clinic, for fear of having to put their pet to sleep. This is a difficult scenario and unfortunately, the veterinarian has to put the patient's best interest before the client's. The topic of euthanasia is best avoided over the phone and the goal should be to convince the client to bring their pet to the veterinary clinic, so that the patient might receive pain relief and be assessed by a veterinarian. Once in the clinic, the veterinarian can educate the client to do what is best for their pet, even if that means euthanasia.

It is rare for a veterinary clinic to refuse returning a patient to a client and/or perform welfare euthanasia without the client's consent.
