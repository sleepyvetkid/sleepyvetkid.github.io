## Veterinary Trauma Triage (ATT)<sup>1</sup>

There are 6 categories, each scoring 0-3 points.

If the patient meets multiple criteria across different grades, choose the higher grade.

Total the points to get an ATT score (out of 18).

## Interpretation

Most dogs and cats with trauma will score 3 or less. Very few will score 10 or more.<sup>2,3</sup>

Dogs: A prospective, multicentered cohort study of dogs with trauma (n=315) showed that an ATT score of ≥5 had good sensitivity (83%) and excellent specificity (91%) for predicting mortality.<sup>4</sup>

Cats: A retrospective cohort study of cats with trauma (n=530) showed that an ATT score of ≥5 increased the odds of mortality by 7.6 times.<sup>5</sup>

Each point increase is associated with a 2x increase in mortality odds for both dogs and cats.<sup>2,3</sup>

## Description

The veterinary triage trauma (ATT) was developed by a group of experienced emergency veterinarians at the University of Pennsylvania in 1994, with references to veterinary triage guidelines published at that time.

It has since proven useful in predicting mortality in dogs and cats, regardless of the type of trauma.

Two large-scale studies recently externally validated it and showed that the most predictive categories were neurological, perfusion and respiratory. There was no loss in performance when the other 3 categories (eye/muscle/integument, skeletal and cardiovascular) were removed from the calculation of the final score.

## Pros

- In the original retrospective (n=101) and prospective (n=88) cohort study<sup>1</sup>, ATT score was a significant predictor of the likelihood of survival (regression analysis, p<0.0005, goodness-of-fit not tested). For each point increase in overall ATT score, the odds of survival decrease by 2.3 – 2.6 times.

- ATT has been externally validated by multiple studies. The  most significant are two large-scale, multicentered (n=9), retrospective cohort studies using the Veterinary Committee on Trauma (VetCOT) registry.<sup>2,3</sup> They showed that the ATT had excellent predictive ability to predict mortality in dogs (n=3,599, AUROC=0.92) and cats (n=711, AUROC=0.87).

- It is easy to use, requiring only a physical examination without further diagnostic tests.

## Cons

- Radiographs might be required to confirm suspected fracture(s).

## Recommendations

We highly recommend using ATT for all trauma patients due to its ease of use and excellent validity.

Another scoring system, veterinary trauma score (VetCOT), might have better accuracy at predicting mortality, but it requires lactate and iCa<sup>2+</sup>, and has yet to be externally validated.
