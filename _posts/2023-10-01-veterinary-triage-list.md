    <td>A general reduction in muscle tone combined with mental depression. Animals are usually able to stand or walk but are reluctant to rise and will lay down as soon as they are allowed.</td>

    <td>Hyperglycemia with ketosis</td>
    <td>Serum glucose ≥11 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) combined with signs of ketosis. Animals with a history of diabetes mellitus that did not receive insulin for a certain period of time are at risk of having hyperglycemia with ketosis. Sometimes an acetone breath can be perceived.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Pain</td>
    <td>Severe: Uncontrollable and intense. Stops normal activities. Animals may cry out when touched and may become tachycardiac and tachypneic. Painful extremities will not be used or the animal is unable or unwilling to rise.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Moderate: Not immediately life threatening, not worsened in the past hour. Animals can have pale or pink mucous membranes, clear increased work of breathing, may have (intermittent) open mouth breathing, especially when stressed and may have abnormal lung sounds.</td>

    <td></td>
    <td>Mild: Mildly increased work of breathing. Patients do not have open mouth breathing, do not require oxygen therapy and may have localized abnormal lung sounds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Shock (decompensated)</td>
    <td>Inadequate perfusion of tissues. Classical symptoms of early decompensated shock include a reduced level of consciousness, pale mucous membranes, a capillary refill time > 2 seconds, poor peripheral pulse quality, low rectal and peripheral temperature, bradycardia in cats (defined as a heart rate <120/min) and tachycardia in dogs (defined as a heart rate >160/ min). Symptoms of late decompensated shock include bradycardia and an absent capillary refill time.</td>

## Description

The veterinary triage list (VTL) was developed by a private emergency centre in the Netherlands, Medisch Centrum voor Dieren (Animal Medical Center), in 2012.

It was adapted from the Manchester Triage System (MTS), which is the most used triage system in human medicine.

## Pros

- Good agreement with two 'primary investigators' (n=485 dogs and cats; 78% agreement; Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) = 0.85 — very strong positive relationship).

## Cons

- The qualifications and experience of the two ‘primary investigators’ were not specified in the study. The validity is questionable as an instrument is only as good as the standard it was compared to.

- The evaluation was internal and retrospective.

- There are no further validation studies.

## Recommendation

There is little evidence to support its usage, although it may still be a helpful reference.
